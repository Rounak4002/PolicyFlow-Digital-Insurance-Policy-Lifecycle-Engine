# PolicyFlow – Digital Insurance Policy Lifecycle Engine
___________________________________________________________________________________________

## Description
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### PolicyFlow is a modular backend system that manages the complete lifecycle of insurance policies, including policy onboarding, premium handling, lifecycle tracking, and servicing through scalable backend services.
### Insurance policy management is a core operational function that involves handling customer information, policy types, premium structures, timelines, and policy status changes. PolicyFlow is designed to model these real-world insurance processes by translating business rules into structured backend services.
### The platform enables the creation and management of insurance policies while maintaining clarity around policy start dates, end dates, premium amounts, and current status. Through RESTful APIs and a relational data model, PolicyFlow simulates how insurance companies manage policies throughout their lifecycle.
### The project focuses on backend service design, clean data handling, and system-level thinking rather than just basic CRUD operations. It reflects an enterprise mindset by emphasizing modularity, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns, making it suitable for extension into microservices or integration with other insurance platforms.
### PolicyFlow demonstrates the ability to understand operational workflows and convert them into reliable backend systems, which is essential for technology roles in insurance and financial services organizations.
